#baseURI = http://gorest.co.in #Since, there can be multiple BaseURI or Domain URI in different test classes while maintaining multiple projects(Generally, we'll have only one baseURI working in a single project in company)
#So, we cannot maintain multiple baseURIs in a single config.properties file, so instead we can pass this baseURI as a parameter in testng.xml(runner) file. In various Testblocks we can pass it as the baseURI parameter. Easy to maintain as well.
